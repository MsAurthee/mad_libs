# Mad Lips

Mad Lips is a playful, terminal-based Mad Libs-style game that’s designed to be silly, friendly, and super easy to share. It asks for words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.), but if you don't feel like thinking, type `?` and the game will surprise you with a random, goofy suggestion. Save your favorite results to a file and replay as many times as you like.

## Why this exists
This is my second Python project — a tiny, joyful program made to make friends, family, or anyone you pair it with laugh. It’s simple, interactive, and perfect for practicing Python I/O and string formatting while having fun.

## Features
- Several quirky story templates (The Great Escape, Space Tourist, Magical Job Interview, Haunted Recipe).
- User input with a “surprise” option: type `?` to auto-fill a funny suggestion.
- Clear, colorful terminal output (ANSI colors) and a neat ASCII header.
- Option to pick a specific template or get a random one.
- Save completed stories to a timestamped `.txt` file.
- Cross-platform clear-screen support (`cls` for Windows, `clear` for Unix).
- Lightweight — runs on plain Python 3 (no external dependencies).

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
